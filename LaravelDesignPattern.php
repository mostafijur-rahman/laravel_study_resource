// 1. What are Design Patterns?
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Software development’s recurrent issues can be solved through design patterns. 
// They act as guidelines for writing organised, reusable code. Design patterns in the context of Laravel offer programmers a set of principles
// and best practises that guarantee the production of high-quality applications.

// Here are some common design patterns used in Laravel:

1. MVC Pattern (model, view, controller)
2. Repository Pattern
3. Factory Pattern

4. Singleton Pattern
5. Observer Pattern
6. Strategy Pattern
7. Facades Pattern
8. Adapter Pattern


Benefits of Design Patterns:

Code Reusability:Design patterns encourage code reuse, enabling you to make advantage of current solutions and cut down on duplicate code. This improves output and cuts down on development time.

Scalability: Your codebase becomes modular and versatile when you use design patterns. As your needs change, you can quickly adapt and scale your application.

Code Organisation:Design patterns help your code have a clear structure, which makes it simpler to comprehend and maintain. This results in better teamwork and quicker debugging.

Maintainability: By following design patterns, you can make sure that your code is well-organised and adheres to current standards. This makes maintenance easier and lessens the chance of adding bugs.
